* ob-aider.el

An Org Babel library for sending prompts to an already running Aider.el comint buffer directly from Org mode source blocks.

** Overview

=ob-aider.el= allows you to interact with [[https://github.com/tninja/aider.el][aider.el]] directly from Org mode documents. This enables you to:

- Document your AI-assisted coding sessions in Org mode
- Send prompts to Aider from within your Org documents
- Capture Aider's responses as results in your Org document
- Create reproducible AI-assisted coding workflows

** Requirements

- Emacs 27.1 or later
- Org mode 9.4 or later
- [[https://github.com/tninja/aider.el][aider.el]]

** Installation

*** MELPA (Coming Soon)

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package ob-aider
  :ensure t)
#+end_src

*** Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   #+begin_src bash
   git clone https://github.com/localredhead/ob-aider.el.git
   #+end_src

2. Add the following to your Emacs configuration:
   #+begin_src elisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ob-aider")
   (require 'ob-aider)
   
   ;; Enable aider in org-babel
   (with-eval-after-load 'org
     (org-babel-do-load-languages
      'org-babel-load-languages
      (append org-babel-load-languages
              '((aider . t)))))
   #+end_src

*** Using straight.el and use-package

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package ob-aider
  :straight (:host github :repo "levistrope/ob-aider.el")
  :after org
  :config
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   (append org-babel-load-languages
           '((aider . t)))))
#+end_src

*** For Doom Emacs users

In your =~/.doom.d/packages.el= file, add:
#+begin_src elisp
(package! ob-aider
  :recipe (:host github :repo "levistrope/ob-aider.el"))
#+end_src

In your =~/.doom.d/config.el= file, add:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! ob-aider
  :after org
  :config
  (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages '(aider . t))
  (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages org-babel-load-languages))
#+end_src

Then run =doom sync= to install the package.

** Usage

1. Start an Aider session using =M-x aider-start= or your preferred method.

2. In your Org document, create an Aider source block:
   #+begin_src org
   #+begin_src aider
   Please refactor this function to be more efficient...
   #+end_src
   #+end_src

3. Execute the block with =C-c C-c= to send the prompt to the active Aider session.

4. The response from Aider will be captured and displayed as the result of the source block.

*** Asynchronous Execution

For long-running prompts, you can use asynchronous execution:

#+begin_src org
#+begin_src aider :async t
Your complex prompt here...
#+end_src
#+end_src

** Customization

You can customize the behavior of =ob-aider= through the following variables:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Set timeout for waiting for Aider responses (in seconds)
(setq ob-aider-timeout 60)

;; Set delay between checks for Aider response completion
(setq ob-aider-response-delay 0.1)

;; Set default async behavior
(setq ob-aider-default-async nil)
#+end_src

** Troubleshooting

- *No active Aider conversation buffer found*: Make sure you have started an Aider session before executing an Aider source block.
- *Response timeout*: If Aider takes longer than expected to respond, you can increase the =ob-aider-timeout= value.

** Use Cases

*** GPTel + ob-aider: A Powerful Combination

One of the most powerful workflows enabled by =ob-aider= is the combination with [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][GPTel]] or similar Emacs LLM interfaces. This creates a seamless AI-assisted development environment:

**** Integrated AI Workflow

The combination of GPTel and ob-aider creates a synergistic workflow where:

- *GPTel* helps you craft and refine prompts within your Org document
- *ob-aider* sends those refined prompts to your Aider session for code generation and modification
- *Org mode* documents the entire process in a single, executable document

This workflow allows you to leverage different AI tools for their respective strengths - using a general-purpose LLM to help formulate effective prompts for the code-focused Aider tool. The entire conversation history, thought process, and resulting code changes are preserved in a single Org document that can be shared, revisited, or modified later.

This integration transforms your Org documents into interactive AI-assisted development environments, where you can seamlessly move between brainstorming, prompt refinement, code generation, and documentation - all while maintaining a complete record of your development process.
